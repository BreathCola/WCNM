# RT-GS Status

Current stage: Stage B — Differentiable Ray Tracing and Reflection

Current branch: `feature/stage-b-reflection-dr-c03`

Stage state: Stage A is formally closed. Stage B-0 was approved by the user and
B-1a/B-1b/B-1c implementation is present with synthetic/CUDA tests passing.
The first user-operated TiHuBird smoke restored D and initialized R, then
aborted before its first optimization step on an ASCII-locale CUDA JIT path
error. The user-operated `smoke_2_retry1` then completed 2/2 steps from the
fixed code and produced a valid Stage B checkpoint, independent D/R PLYs, and
real debug maps. Review found nearly complete ray hits plus physical-scale maps
that quantized black/saturated white, so B-1d debug-only observability is now
implemented and tested but awaits a user-operated one-step resume smoke. Stage B
is neither complete nor accepted. The frozen StableNormal baseline and C03
initialization artifacts remain unchanged. Stage C and Stage D have not started.

Stage B branch point: `772c0c0e1c9fec012a10795101e874e2bc065c44`

Stage A code evidence commit: `829dd82dc74f4c5dce640201448626df24afa25a`

## Repository and scene

- The original 3DGS baseline remains available through `--model_type 3dgs`.
- RT-GS uses `--model_type surfel` and the pinned 2D surfel rasterizer.
- Diffuse and Reflection now have separate Stage B models, optimizers,
  schedulers, densification state, checkpoint namespaces, PLY exports, and debug
  outputs. No Transmittance model or Stage C/D path exists.
- `data/TiHuBird` is the real acceptance scene. Truck artifacts are historical
  engineering smoke evidence only.
- TiHuBird has 111 final undistorted PINHOLE images at 3827x2152, 111/111 COLMAP
  registrations, and 84,989 sparse points.

## Frozen StableNormal Stage A baseline

- The frozen rollback branch is `baseline/stage-a-stablenormal` at
  `3e9f62ae8b34eaaf77ce67ba86a077041aaa5f04`.
- The accepted D-only output is
  `output/stage_a_tihubird_30k_mono001_r2_retry1/` with
  `lambda_mono=0.01`. Its 30,000-step checkpoint and point cloud remain present
  and must not be overwritten, moved, or modified.
- Generated all 111 TiHuBird StableNormal priors in
  `data/TiHuBird/normal_priors/` and passed strict validation: 111 images, 111
  priors, 111 manifest entries, with empty missing, unexpected, duplicate, and
  abnormal lists. Evidence:
  `output/stage_a_tihubird_priors_validate_111.log`.
- The matched `lambda_mono=0` and `lambda_mono=0.01` retry1 runs completed to
  30,000 iterations. The first `lambda_mono=0.01` attempt stopped around
  iteration 230 without a usable checkpoint and remains excluded.
- Gate 9 matched metrics and the global comparison are present at
  `output/stage_a_tihubird_30k_matched_metrics.txt` and
  `output/stage_a_tihubird_30k_matched_comparison.png`; Gate 9.5 six-view and
  crop evidence remains under `output/stage_a_tihubird_gate9p5/`.

## DiffusionRenderer C03 exploratory result

- DiffusionRenderer priors were evaluated independently on
  `feature/stage-a-diffrender-priors`; they never replaced or modified the
  StableNormal baseline.
- C03 completed 15,000 D-only iterations at
  `output/stage_a_tihubird_drnormal_c03_15k/`. The log
  `output/stage_a_tihubird_drnormal_c03_15k.log` records saves at 7,000 and
  15,000, checkpoint saves at 7,000/10,000/15,000, and `Training complete.`
- Its 15,000-step train metrics are L1 `0.021616848371922973` and PSNR
  `26.401429367065433`. The matched StableNormal retry1 15,000-step metrics are
  L1 `0.020849463716149333` and PSNR `26.722418594360352`.
- C03 trained stably and did not show the front glass surface swallowing the
  bird subject. The RGB/normal/depth audit nevertheless did not establish a
  clear D-only advantage over the frozen StableNormal baseline. Therefore C03
  will not be extended to 30,000 D-only iterations.
- The comparison image is
  `output/stage_a_tihubird_drnormal_c03_15k/comparison_vs_stablenormal_15k.png`.
- The C03 15,000-step checkpoint is a readable `rtgs_stage_a` checkpoint at
  iteration 15,000 with 346,118 finite Diffuse surfels. Its usable initialization
  artifacts are:

  ```text
  output/stage_a_tihubird_drnormal_c03_15k/chkpnt15000.pth
  output/stage_a_tihubird_drnormal_c03_15k/point_cloud/iteration_15000/
  ```

- These C03 artifacts are read-only Stage B initialization candidates. C03 is
  not a proven replacement for the StableNormal D-only configuration.

## Tests and verified behavior

- `MAX_JOBS=4 conda run --no-capture-output -n RT-GS python -m pytest -q
  tests` → 69 passed on 2026-06-30. This includes the complete Stage A
  regression plus 31 Stage B model/ray/BRDF/checkpoint/render/debug/mask/JIT
  staging tests.
- The CUDA extension compiled successfully for PyTorch 2.0.1 + CUDA 11.8 on an
  RTX 3090. CUDA/oracle consistency, chunking, refit/rebuild, and nonzero
  finite-difference gradients for xyz/rotation/scaling/opacity/color/ray
  origin/ray direction passed.
- Original 3DGS and surfel training/render paths, checkpoint resume, PLY reload,
  densification, material gradients, and Stage A debug exports have passed their
  documented checks.
- Synthetic Stage B rendering produced real reflection hit/color/alpha/depth,
  D/F/G/fr/wr, and diffuse/reflection contribution tensors and debug files in
  pytest temporary directories only.
- The user-operated `smoke_2` attempt created only initialization/config/event
  artifacts and stopped at 0/2 steps before any checkpoint or D/R PLY save. Its
  attached log identifies `UnicodeEncodeError` while PyTorch writes the CUDA JIT
  Ninja file from the non-ASCII repository path. Codex did not run this smoke or
  modify its partial output.
- A fresh forced-C-locale CUDA compile reported preferred encoding
  `ANSI_X3.4-1968` and loaded the extension successfully from the new ASCII-only
  staging path. No real manual soft-mask set exists yet.
- The user-operated `smoke_2_retry1` completed at global iteration 15,002 and R
  local step 2. Its `rtgs_stage_b` checkpoint contains 346,118 Diffuse and 4,096
  Reflection surfels, separate optimizer namespaces, and no non-finite tensor in
  recursive D/R state inspection. The independent D/R PLYs and both debug nodes
  are present. C03 source checkpoint and PLY hashes remain unchanged.
- The reviewed fixed view had 128,582 valid rays and 128,579 final alpha hits.
  Reflection color/alpha/depth were spatially structured, but the physical
  reflection contribution quantized to black and microfacet D display-clamped
  to white. B-1d now preserves these physical images while adding p99/log
  companion views, raw statistics, candidate/exact-intersection counts, CUDA
  phase timing, and peak-memory metadata only on requested debug renders.

## Current boundary and next exact task

- The next action is a user-operated one-step resume smoke from the read-only
  `output/stage_b_tihubird_reflection_dr_c03_smoke_2_retry1/chkpnt15002.pth`
  with `lambda_spec=0`, using a new output path.
- Inspect the new raw statistics, candidate/exact-intersection distributions,
  timing/memory metadata, and companion maps before changing Reflection count,
  scale, initialization, or training duration.
- `lambda_spec=0` must keep `--specular_masks` empty and emits no mask/overlay.
  Enabling the constraint later requires a complete real 111/111 manual soft
  mask set with matching dimensions and recorded aggregate hash.
- Stage B solves reflection only. It must not claim transmission,
  bird/background separation, transparent mesh, or two-hit geometry.
- Do not start a matched StableNormal-versus-C03 Stage B comparison in parallel.
  It may be designed later if the reflection hypothesis requires it.
- Stage C and Stage D remain forbidden until their own acceptance and explicit
  stage transitions.

Blocked by: the user-operated one-step diagnostic resume and review of its
candidate density, exact intersections, timing/memory, and display companions;
then a real 111/111 manual soft-mask set before enabling `lambda_spec>0`. Stage B
acceptance cannot advance before that evidence exists.
